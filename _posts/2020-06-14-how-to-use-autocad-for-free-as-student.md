In this article, i’ll show you step-by-step guide how to get AutoCAD Student Version for FREE. But before we get started, please don’t exploit this offer for commercial use, if you already have a job and made enough money, please consider to support AutoCAD by buying it’s persona license.

1. Go to [https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/featured](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/featured), and select which AutoDesk software you want to have as a Student Version.
